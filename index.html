    <h1>My name is Adam Akhtar</h1>
    <p>I am a freshman hoping to transfer into Computer Science at NC State ideally. I enjoy gaming with my friends as well as reading on any downtime I get. I don't particularly like sports if it's not taken seriously, However, I enjoy playing and watching soccer even if I'm not very good at it.</p>
