# **About me**

## My interests

My hobbies are gaming with friends, and reading. I enjoy playing various multiplayer games with friends as I believe gaming becomes much more enjoyable when playing with others. In my free time when my friends aren't available or when I want to do something alone, I read. I enjoy math and as a college course I find coding and scripting pretty enjoyable, I find that when I complete a program and it works out just as I intended, that it is fun.

## Websites I recommend

[_YouTube_] (www.youtube.com) - YouTube is a website where you can find nearly everything you could want in the format of a video, this includes entertainment, education, tutorials etc.. You can even create videos to help or entertain others. I use YouTube for entertainment and for tutorials if I'm uncertain about something.

[_Discord_] (www.discord.com) - Discord can be used as a communication device between friends and groups that shares similarities to skype but is a lot more catered towards people who use laptops and computers. I use Discord whenever I game with my friends because it allows me to share my screen and connect in a voice call at the click of a button. There are also servers that I don't use very often, but can be used with a group of people in common interest.
